Aim: Random module functions with explanation.
•	Random module:
o	Random module in python is used to generate pseudo-random variables.
o	It can generate random numbers as well as can select elements randomly from the list. 
o	It can also shuffle elements of the specified list.
o	Following is the example of random module functions and their usage:

Task – 3(B)
Aim: Build a password generator program containing numbers, alphabets and characters.

Task – 3(C)
Aim: Write a note about NLP, NLU and NLG with example.
•	NLP:
o	NLP stands for Natural Language Processing.
o	NLP is a technique of machine learning which is used for making a computer understand, process and analyze as well as manipulate human language. It can also generate human language.
o	NLP can be used in many real-life areas:
a.	Auto – prediction: Google search predicts the results on the basis of NLP.
b.	Sentiment Analysis: Obtaining the sentiment of user.
c.	Machine Translation: To translate one language to another via a tool.
d.	Speech Recognition: Google Vocalware or WebSpeech.
o	NLP has two subsets:
1.	NLU
2.	NLG

•	NLU:
o	NLU stands for Natural Language Understanding.
o	NLU is a branch of NLP.
o	It is mainly used to transform the natural human language to a machine-readable format.
o	A computer with the capability of machine learning can operate NLU and analyze large datasets resulting into efficient analysis. 
o	It mainly works on how a machine may analyze and understand an unstructured data.
o	Example of NLU:
a.	Question Answering 
b.	Machine Translation
c.	Data Capture

•	NLG:
o	NLG stands for Natural Language Generation.
o	NLG is a type of AI (Artificial Intelligence) which is used to generate natural language from a structured set of data.
o	NLG is a subset of NLP and Machine learning, neural network as well as deep learning is used by NLG to generate natural language.
o	Some of the applications of NLG are as follows:
a.	Building Chatbots
b.	Automated Lead Nurturing
c.	Text Generation
d.	Building Voice Assistants

•	Working of NLP, NLU and NLG collaboratively:

o	NLU will initially try to understand the data based on:
1.	Grammar
2.	The context in which it was said
3.	Decision on entities as well as intent.
o	NLP will convert the NLU generated text into structured data.
o	NLG will then generate text which is based on the NLP generated structured data.


 
[NLP Pipeline]
1.	Text Information: Entering the sound converted to text or text.
2.	Segmentation and Tokenization: Segmentation of text into different components.
3.	Text Cleaning: Filtering garbage and discarding unnecessary components/elements.
4.	Vectorization and Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into vector data.
5.	Text Lemmatization and Stemming: Removing last characters which are unwanted and applying lemma.
6.	Machine Learning Algorithms: To use ML Algorithms to train models.
7.	Interpretation of Result: Obtaining final result in structured form.
