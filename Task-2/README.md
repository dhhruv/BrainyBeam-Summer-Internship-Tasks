## Task-2

**Aim:** List out the methods used commonly in list, set, tuple and dictionary with their rules.

1.  List:
    *   A list is an in-built datatype which is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    *   Lists are mutable.
    *   Lists are declared by ‘[ ]’.
    *   The different examples of list with their methods are shown in [task2a.py](./task2a.py).

2.  Set:
    *   A set is an unordered collection datatype.
    *   It is iterable as well as mutable.
    *   Duplicate values can’t be added to a set.
    *   Set is defined by ‘{ }’.
    *   Set uses the concept of hash and indexing is not supported.
    *   The example of set with its methods are shown in [task2b.py](./task2b.py).

3.  Tuple:
    *   A tuple is a datatype which is used to store multiple data items in a single variable.
    *   It is an ordered collection and it is immutable.
    *   Tuples are specified by ‘( )’.
    *   Tuple may contain duplicate values.
    *   To fetch values from a tuple, ‘[ ]’ is used.
    *   The examples of tuple with its methods are shown in [task2c.py](./task2c.py).

4.  Dictionary:
    *   Dictionary is an unordered collection of data values and it is used to store values.
    *   The dictionary contains a ‘key’ and a ‘value’ associated with that key.
    *   The values in a dictionary can be accessed through the key rather than an index. 
    *   The key is assigned to a value with the help of ‘:’.
    *   The example of dictionary is shown in [task2d.py](./task2d.py).
