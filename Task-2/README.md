Aim: List out the methods used commonly in list, set, tuple & dictionary with their rules.
•	List:
o	A list is an in-built datatype which is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
o	Lists are mutable.
o	Lists are declared by ‘[ ]’.
o	Following are the different examples of list with their methods:

•	Set:
o	A set is an unordered collection datatype.
o	It is iterable as well as mutable.
o	Duplicate values can’t be added to a set.
o	Set is defined by ‘{ }’
o	Set uses the concept of hash and indexing is not supported.
o	The example of set with its methods is as follows: 

•	Tuple:
o	A tuple is a datatype which is used to store multiple data items in a single variable.
o	It is an ordered collection and it is immutable.
o	Tuples are specified by ‘( )’.
o	Tuple may contain duplicate values.
o	To fetch values from a tuple, ‘[ ]’ is used.
o	Following is the example of tuple with its methods:

•	Dictionary:
o	Dictionary is an unordered collection of data values and it is used to store values.
o	The dictionary contains a ‘key’ and a ‘value’ associated with that key.
o	The values in a dictionary can be accessed through the key rather than an index. 
o	The key is assigned to a value with the help of ‘:’.
o	Following is the example of dictionary:
